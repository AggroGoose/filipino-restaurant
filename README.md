# Project Overview

This project started as a fun concept my wife and I were discussing for a Filipino Restaurant focused on noodles. I decided to attempt drawing up a quick two page restaurant website with a main restaurant overview and a menu page.

In this project I used Sveltekit to familiarize myself with Sveltekit 2.0 and Svelte 5 to compare to NextJS/React ecosystem. I used Firebase Firestore as a backend 'API' to pull menu items into the site and play with Sveltekits preload SSR options. Ultimately the interactions were very smooth and were I building an SSR heavy app I'd likely prefer Sveltekit over NextJS, though I still think NextJS ISR and Image optimization are best for a static app.

You could argue that the menu won't change much so this is essentially a static app, but being relatively small in size I don't think the differences are that major.

Ultimately, between the preload files and the smooth interactions with Svelte 5 runes for state management, I continue to find Svelte pleasant to work with.
